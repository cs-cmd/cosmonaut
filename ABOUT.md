# Cosmonaut
## A text editor for multi-value (MV) databases
This project was started in response to the available tools for UniVerse
database application/query development.

My research/job position has led me to three tools available to me: mvDeveloper,
a VS Code extension made by Rocket (the current maintainer of UniVerse), and the
original 'ED' editor. I did not have access to 'ED', the VS Code extension
proved too fragile to use effectively, and mvDeveloper had too few features for
me to feel productive enough. Hence, __Cosmonaut__.

I'm hopeful this will develop into a feature-rich, open-source, free, and fairly
customizable application for a one-man project. By the end, I'm hoping to
implement auto-complete, debugging, code completion with UniVerse Dictionary
support, and the ability to run RetrieVe queries and UniVerse BASIC programs
right in the application.

I will be using Rust with the Tauri framework, which allows for a web-based
frontend. I enjoy web development, despite its flaws, and I'm hopeful it will
open up a fair amount of customization for developers to personalize their own
environment.

As a one-man project, written by someone that will not be able to devote their
full, undivided attention to this project, I'm anticipating a long development
period. I'm hopeful of the end result!
